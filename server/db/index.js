// The purpose of this module is to bring your Sequelize instance (`db`) together
// with your models (which you should define in separate modules in this directory).
// Example:
//
// const Puppy = require('./puppy')
// const Owner = require('./owner')

// After you've required all of your models into this module, you should establish
// associations (https://sequelize-guides.netlify.com/association-types/) between them here as well!
// Example:
//
Photographs.belongsTo(Artists);
Artists.hasMany(Photographs);

module.exports = {
  // Include your models in this exports object as well!
  Artists,
  Photographs,
  db
}
